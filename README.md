# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS styles fail to apply due to missing or incorrect configuration.  The bug involves a simple component where Tailwind classes are added, but the expected styles do not render. The solution involves verifying the Tailwind configuration and build process.

## Bug Description

In this example, we expect a red background and padding on a div element. However, due to a configuration issue, the element remains unstyled. This might be due to incorrect installation or improper setup within your build process.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application (you may need to install dependencies first).
3. Observe that the div element lacks the expected styling from Tailwind CSS.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Tailwind CSS configuration, ensuring it is correctly installed, and that the build process is correctly processing the Tailwind directives. Check your `tailwind.config.js` file for correctness.  If you are using a build tool like Webpack, ensure that the Tailwind plugin is correctly set up.
